# Sharing Code the Right Way

Tutorial from the **DDLS 2025 workshop** on improving the FAIRness and openness of research code on GitHub.

This tutorial applies the [Open Software Checklist](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/open-science-checklists/blob/main/open_software_checklist.md) ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.17044/scilifelab.29086775)) to improve the openness of your repository.

Each point is broken down into what needs to be addressed, why it matters, and how to solve it.
To make this concrete, every point has been applied to an example repository, the [ook-translator](https://github.com/almanilsson/ook-translator). The “ook-translator” is a mock application that translates between human and orangutan language, inspired by Terry Pratchetts Discworld Librarian who only speaks in “ook” sounds (not relevant for the tutorial, don't worry).

You can find the tutorial at **[sharing-code-the-right-way.md](sharing-code-the-right-way.md)** in this repository, and the introductory presentation under **[resources/tutorial_introduction_20251113.pdf](resources/tutorial_introduction_20251113.pdf)**.

## The Example Repository

The example repository starts from a state that does not fulfil any points on the Open Software Checklist, and then goes through and solves them in the order of the tutorial. Each commit (roughly) corresponds to one tutorial point.
You can browse all commits here:
[ook-translator commits](https://github.com/almanilsson/ook-translator/commits/main)

You are encouraged to apply the tutorial to your own repository, or create a new one.
If you don't have one yet, you can use the initial “messy” version of the *ook-translator* as a starting point, but be warned, it is intentionally confusing!
